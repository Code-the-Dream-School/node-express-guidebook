# Node.js/Express Learning Objectives

***Note:** These learning objectives reflect Code the Dream's 15-week Node.js/Express course. These will be updated in spring 2026, when the course shifts to 11 weeks.*

## Overall Learning Objectives

In this course, students will:

1. **Design and build full-stack web applications using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.**
Students will develop the backend skills necessary to create, secure, and deploy dynamic web applications using Express, RESTful routing, middleware, and MongoDB for data persistence, while integrating authentication, error handling, and server-side rendering.

2. **Apply real-world backend development practices to build scalable APIs and services.**
Students will manage packages and dependencies with NPM, handle asynchronous patterns with modern JavaScript, use testing tools like Mocha and Chai, and follow structured development workflows to build and document a robust final project.
