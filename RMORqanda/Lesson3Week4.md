6. In your own words describe a RESTful API

   An example answer: a way for applications to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage resources. It organizes resources (such as data or services) into URLs, allowing clients to interact with them in a simple, stateless manner. The API typically returns data in formats like JSON or XML, making it easy to integrate with various systems.
