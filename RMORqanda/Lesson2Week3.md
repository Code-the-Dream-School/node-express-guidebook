2. How do you handle errors in a promise chain using .catch()? - **ANSWERS: D**

   a) .catch() is used to log errors to the console
  
   b) .catch() is used to retry the promise if it fails
  
   c) .catch() is used to transform the value of a promise
  
   **d) .catch() is used after a .then() method to handle errors**



3. Which of the following statements are true about the await keyword? (Select all that apply) - **ANSWERS: A and D**

   **a) It pauses the execution of the async function until the promise is resolved**
  
   b) It executes the next line of code regardless of the promise status

6. In your own words describe a promise:
Provide a written response below but also speak this question aloud as if interviewing for practice

   **Example answer:** an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises provide a way to work with asynchronous code more effectively than traditional callback methods, allowing for cleaner and more manageable code.


8. In your own words describe a server:
Provide a written response below but also speak this question aloud as if interviewing for practice

   **Example answer:** a system or program that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. Servers play a crucial role in client-server architecture, where they handle requests from clients and respond with the appropriate resources or information.
