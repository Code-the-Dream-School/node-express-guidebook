5. Did the past two weeks building out an API give you an idea or change your idea for your project?  If yes, how?  If no, please take a moment now and share an idea or two that comes to mind that you may want to consider for your final project.

   No right or wrong answers here, but please be sure you're having conversations with your students in sessions and 1:1 meetings about their ideas and concepts for a final project.
