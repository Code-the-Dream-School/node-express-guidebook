**Explore Sessions** → Big-picture understanding, discussion, mini-demos  
**Apply Sessions** → Practice with guidance, code review, debugging

**Mix-and-match** is totally fine!

### ✅ Try This Live

> “Let’s try this as a group!”

<pre><code class="language-js">
// Sample starter code or prompt here
</code></pre>

Ask follow-up questions like:
- “What happens if we remove this line?”
- “Can we do the same thing a different way?”

## 💬 Engagement Strategies (for quiet groups)

- **Think Time + Chat**: “Try this yourself first, then paste your code.”
- **Pick One**: “Which technique would you choose and why?”
- **Vote + Explain**: “React with an emoji if you've seen this bug before.”
- **Start Messy**: “Let’s break this code and fix it together!”
